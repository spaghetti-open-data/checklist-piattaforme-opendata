A5;"Allows to perform a data quality check (and related data refinement);";"Not directly;";"Not directly, but it enables quality check, such as  identifying data types for values;";"Not as embedded functionality, but a OpenRefine extension is available for CKAN; ";"Not as embedded functionality, but ENGAGE provides a strong integration with OpenRefine); Besides, data curation by the community is encouraged;"
A6;"Is designed to be integrated with (or includes) a front-end / open data portal;";"Yes, it is planned to integrate Open-DAI as a back-end of the Open Data portal of the Piedmont Region;";"Yes, but poorly customizable;Ongoing attempts by third parties, such as an integration point with Drupal is being developed , still in Alpha mode;";"Yes; On top of the standard front-end, there are well experimented modules for Drupal and Wordpress;";"Yes; A full-fledged front-end is included;"

B2;"Designed to publish dynamic data;";"Yes;";"Yes;";"No, only static files;";"Yes;"
B3;"Designed to expose geo-referenceable data;";"Yes;";"Yes;";"No, but allows to expose georeferenced metadata;";"Yes;"
B4;"Designed to expose Linked Open Data (meaning at least RDF triple store+SPARQL endpoint+other features, such as ontology mapping);";"Yes;";"No;The ‘Community edition’ allows data exposure as RDF, but with no triple store, nor SPARQL endpoint;";"No, just linked metadata;";"Yes;"
B5;"Presents prototypes of data reuse;";"Yes, for instance Open-DAI pilot services;";"Yes;";"Yes, such as tabular previews;";"Yes, derived datasets;"
C1;"Released as open-source software;";"Yes;";"Not the standard edition (Yes, in case of the ‘Community Edition’);";"Yes;";"Not yet, however the consortium is inclined to release the basic engine under the MIT License;"
