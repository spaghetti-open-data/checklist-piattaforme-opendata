We derive parameters from requirements (explicitly or implicitly) expressed in several public documents. This first set of sources encompass: legislation at European (e.g., the PSI Directive, the INSPIRE Directive), national (e.g, the Italian Code for the Digital Administration) and local (e.g, Piedmont legislation on PSI) level; strategic plans related with the implementation of the EU Digital Agenda (e.g., EU eGOV action plan5, European Interoperability Framework, the “Connecting Europe Facility” proposal of regulation; the “Open Data Support” initiative by DG CONNECT); national guidelines on public sector information management (e.g, UK Open Data white paper; UK Public information management principles; UK Open Standards Principles; Guidelines on public sector information reuse by the Italian Agency for digital policies; Open Data vademecum by Formez); tender specifications for open data portals (e.g., the call for tender for the EU open data portal; the call for tender for the open data portal of the Lazio Region); studies (e.g., “Study on persistent URIs” by ISA;  Garcia et al., 2005, "E-government success factors: Mapping practical tools to theoretical foundations”.

As a result of an extraction carried out in two steps (i.e., the first one meant to elicit a long-list of preliminary requirements drawing on aforementioned sources, and the second one aimed at distilling the short-list of refined requirements adopted as criteria for benchmarking purposes), 18 requirements have been finally obtained with the idea of capturing basic recurrent features characterizing a ‘state-of-the-art’ platform for data publication. Those requirements were organised in four categories, defined from the point of view of a data holder adopting and using the platform, and describing: (i) publication features (capturing, e.g., the process through which data are published) [A1 to A8]; (ii) data features (e.g., in terms of standards supported by the platform) [B1 to B5]; (iii) the platform architecture, or other general features [C1 to C3]; (iv) add-ons [D1 to D2]. Arguably, this categorisation is just one amongst the many possible, also considering that the impact of most of the features can be reflected in several aspects at the same time. For instance, specific platform features are supposed to also maximise data reusability (beyond enabling data holders to effectively engage in a publication strategy).
